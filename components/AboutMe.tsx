                        Three years ago, I began my coding journeyâ€”a decision I cherish and often wish I had made earlier. As a self-taught developer with a year and a half of professional experience at Yurik B.V - AI Solutions and Projects, I find immense joy in programming and strongly believe in its power to create meaningful change for individuals and society.

                            At Yurik B.V., I co-worked closely with the project owner Yura, who also served as my mentor. While he focused on developing the AI side of our projects, I was responsible for designing and implementing intuitive front-end interfaces and contributing partially to the back-end. This collaboration not only deepened my expertise in front-end development but also allowed me to gain hands-on experience working with AI technologies, expanding my technical skill set.

His guidance, patience, and willingness to share knowledge have been instrumental in my growth as a developer. Thank you for believing in me and providing the opportunities that helped shape my career in tech.&rdquo;
